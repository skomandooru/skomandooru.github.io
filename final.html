	<p>What is the history of Origami?<br></p>
	<p>History of Origami:
	Origami was originally from Japan. 
	It came from a legend that a friend had 
	a 100 origami cranes for her friend who was very sick 
	in the hospital. 
	It was made to make her happy and 
	not feel depressed from the fact that she 
	will eventually die in a few days.
